This field is intended to be used by cluster administrators to enforce that nodes can be cycled within a given time period. When set, drifted nodes will begin draining even if there are pods blocking eviction. Draining will respect PDBs and the do-not-disrupt annotation until the TGP is reached. Karpenter will preemptively delete pods so their terminationGracePeriodSeconds align with the node's terminationGracePeriod. If a pod would be terminated without being granted its full terminationGracePeriodSeconds prior to the node timeout, that pod will be deleted at T = node timeout - pod terminationGracePeriodSeconds. The feature can also be used to allow maximum time limits for long-running jobs which can delay node termination with preStop hooks. If left undefined, the controller will wait indefinitely for pods to be drained."
